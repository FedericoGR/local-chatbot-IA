# Web-LLM Chatbot

This is a simple HTML/JS/CSS starter template for building a ChatGPT-like chatbot using the Web-LLM library and TinyLlama v1.0.

## Usage

To use the chatbot, simply type a message into the input field and press Enter. The chatbot will then generate a response based on your input.

## **Important Note:**

This chatbot runs locally in your browser, which can be computationally expensive. Please be mindful of your PC's resources.

I've used a smaller version of Llama (TinyLlama v1.0) to mitigate this issue. However, if you're looking for more options, you can check out the full list of available models on the Web-LLM website and swap them out as needed.
